## Secured Object
This project contains the code to create an object which users may interact with but not modify outside of the defined ways.
In this case, a user may read/write two variables and read another. A user may also call certain functions. Outside of those defined accesses, user interaction is restricted. The object is defined to allow easy addition of mutable and immutable objects in the source code. \
More information, regarding defined usage, is documented in the source file.
